As part of the course project, it is necessary to develop an object-oriented information system that models
the "Shooting range" subject area, based on the Weapon and Gun classes presented in task variant No. 5.
The weapon.exe program being developed is intended for use in higher educational institutions to demonstrate
knowledge acquired by a student in the field of technology for developing object-oriented programs using
the C++ language.
The software product must operate in the following modes:
a) demonstration of the description of the Weapon and Gun classes and the performance of class member functions:
1) constructors: Weapon (int Capacity, int Caliber, int Distance), Gun (int Capacity, int Caliber, int Distance,
int Number, char *BarrelType);
2) destructor;
3) Actionxx member functions;
b) demonstrating the performance of the Gun class when overloading the binary operator ! (new action - put / remove
from the fuse);
c) demonstration of the operability of the Weapon and Gun classes with single inheritance;
d) help system:
1) about the program (programme document “Program Description”);
2) operator's manual (program document "Operator's manual");
3) about the author.
